# CMGPD-LN 
This folder here provides:
1)the necessary C++ codes for generating the occupational information from the DATASET information and the POSITION_CODE information provided by the datasets. 
2) the necessary python codes to calculate the distance (in meters) between the two villages in this dataset. 
I thank Xinrui Zhu from Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University for the help. 

# how to use codes for occupation
1. Compling the C++ codes in Visual Studio and generate the .exe files. 
2. Input the inqury occupation (in Hanyu Pinyin) and the program would give out the referring number of DATASET and POSITION_CODE (or POSITION_CODE_2)
  in the following form: 
"replace %occupation% =1 if DATASET==%''% & â€œPOSITION_CODE==%''%" 
3. Paste the output sentences into the Stata file of CMGPD-LN, and it would automatically generate the occupational variables. 

# how to use codes for distances
just put in the latitude and longitude coordinates in the expression : print(distance(latitude1, longitude1, latitude 2, longitude 2)), and it will show the results.
